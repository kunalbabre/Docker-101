# Getting Started with Docker

## About Web Site - Engineers

Engineers is a sophisticated and free engineering website template with a stunning and appealing to the eye web design. It is based on the powerful Bootstrap Framework, which gives Engineers flexibility and extendability. Indeed, Engineers is 100% mobile-friendly and in tune with all modern web browsers. Everyone will have a pleasant experience, browsing your content and filling out the “request a quote” form.

Other treats of Engineers include a massive slideshow, sticky navigation, testimonials, blog pages, as well as newsletter subscription and contact forms. Instead of starting from complete scratch, Engineers offers you a striking layout which you can put into play right away; the theme is just a click away anyway. Spread the word out with this nifty free engineering website template and start making big moves.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we will build a docker image (blueprint for container) for the web site above.

>Analogy: In world of Object Oriented programing you can think of them as Class (blueprint) for the Instances you will be creating.

|   Docker | Programming  | Comment  |
|---|---|---|
| Image  | Class  | Blueprint |
| Container  | Object   | Instance of the Class|

### Install Docker

Let's get started by installing Docker Engine - Community.Docker is available in three tiers:

* Docker Engine - Community
* Docker Engine - Enterprise
* Docker Enterprise (for running Docker workload in production!)

If you would like to learn about [Docker editions](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/)

* [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [Install Docker Desktop for Mac
](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [All other users see here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Download Static Website Engineers

Download [static website - Engineers](assets/Engineers.zip) and unzip into Engineers folder.

### Create Dockerfile

A ```Dockerfile``` (filename without extension) is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

See [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

```bash
#1. Open Termminal / Command line and navigate to folder containing engineering site

#2. Create a Docker File with following details
```

```DockerFile```

```DockerFile
# Start with nginx running on alpine
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy content from current dir to nginx html
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

#EXPOSE instruction to inform Docker that the container will be listening on the specified network ports at runtime
EXPOSE 80/tcp
```

### Docker Build

Let's build an image from a Dockerfile and tag it as ```engineering-app```.

See: [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)

```bash
#1. Open Termminal / Command line and navigate to folder containing the docker file

#2. Now let's build the docker  
docker build -t engineering-app .

```

### View the Docker Images

List all the Docker Images, you should see engineering-app.

See [docker image reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_ls/)

```bash
docker image ls
```

### Docker Run

A container is a process that runs on a host and is statred using ```Docker Run```

Let's run our web app and explose it on port ```8080```.

See: [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

```cmd
docker run -d -p 8080:80 engineering-app
```

### Streach Goal

Identify command to stop the container and remove it (hint: rm).
